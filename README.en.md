- **[Miro](https://miro.com/):** Visual collaboration platform used for *Event Storming* diagrams and initial solution planning.
- **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/):** Centralized documentation hub, containing important project guidelines and development standards.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/):** Version control system for hosting the source code and enabling team collaboration.
- **[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects):** Kanban-style project board used to manage workflow and track issues throughout the project.
- **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** & **[JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/):** IDEs used by the development team for building the .NET 8 application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
- **[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)** installed.  
- **.NET 8 SDK** (to run the API locally).

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabriellongas/fiap-pos-tech-challenge.git
cd fiap-pos-tech-challenge
```

### 2) Start the local infrastructure (Docker)
From the project root (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located), run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
This will start the supporting services (e.g., SQL Server and the log aggregator).

### 3) Run the API
Restore and build the dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

Then run with the command:

```bash
dotnet run --project .\src\FIAP.CloudGames.Api\FIAP.CloudGames.API.csproj
```
The Swagger dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5143/swagger`.

### 4) Access the logs (Seq in Docker)
The application logs are available through the logging service defined in `docker-compose`.  
To access them, go to `http://localhost:5341`.

Login credentials for the tool:

- **User:** admin  
- **Password:** admin123  

There you can filter, search, and view events generated by the API in real-time.
