## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
To run the project, Docker must be installed on your machine.
You can install Docker via the Docker Desktop installation page.

With Docker installed, go to the root folder of the project, where the docker-compose.yml file is located, and run the following command in a terminal:

docker-compose up -d
This will create a SQL Server container ready to be used by the project.
If you want to connect to the database instantiated in Docker, simply use the connection string named "DefaultConnection" found in the appsettings.json file.
